## Hello WorldðŸ‘‹

My name is Holli Davis and I'm a full-stack software engineer! My first venture into the professional world was in the medical field. I spent 3+ years in the medical field constantly learning and gaining certifications so I could better serve my patients. At the start of the pandemic, I connected with a community of software developers who introduced me to the world of code. I immediately fell in love with development. I love the challenge found in problem-solving and the opportunity to be creative when building applications. I decided to make a career change and enrolled in Boise CodeWorks full-stack software development bootcamp. There I participated in over 500 hours of hands-on coding experience over the course of 13 weeks. My development skills grew immensely and after graduation I started putting them to use as a professional software engineer!
