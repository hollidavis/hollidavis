## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

My name is Holli Davis and I'm a full-stack software engineer! At the start of the pandemic, I (like many people) decided to learn a new skill. I connected with a community of software developers online who introduced me to the world of code and I immediately fell in love with development. I loved the challenge found in problem-solving and the opportunity to be creative when building applications. 

Before being introduced to software development, I worked in the medical field for over 3 years. I'm grateful for my time in this field because it enabled me to learn quickly and gave me the opportunity to grow important soft skills like communication, critical thinking, and time management. But I didn't love medicine like I loved coding so I decided to make a career change. I enrolled in Boise CodeWork's full-stack software development boot camp where I participated in over 500 hours of hands-on coding experience over the course of 13 weeks. My development skills grew immensely and after graduating I started putting them to use as a software engineer!
