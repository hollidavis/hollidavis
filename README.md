## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Holli Davis. I am currently a full stack web developer! My first dive into the professional world was in the medical field. I spent nearly 3 years working in a variety of positions ranging from Med Tech to Medical Assistant. I was also attending nursing school and planned on furthering my career in medicine. During that time I started to get involved with Twitch. I started streaming and through that found a community of software developers who helped turn my love of creating and puzzle solving into a love of software development. I decided to make a career change and enrolled in Boise CodeWorks immersive software development bootcamp.

Ever since I was young I've been drawn to creating new things, solving puzzles, and technology. Creativity was the biggest missing piece in my previous career field. When I started to pursue software development I discovered a solution to that problem. I found a career path that allowed me to combined my creative nature with my love of technology. Add in my knack for puzzles and you can see why I chose this field!
